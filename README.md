# Train emotions

This is a repository dedicated for training machine learning models for voice files with emotions (angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, or surprised) from video files downloaded from Youtube.

## Weekly meeting time 

We plan to do slack updates every week 8 PM EST on Fridays. If we need to do a work session, we will arrange for that. Active members of the team working on this repo include:

* Bineeta Gupta (Arizona State University) 
* Luke Lyon (Boulder, CO)
* Anwar Akkari (Yale University) 
* Jim Schwoebel (Boston, MA) 

## Goal / summary or prior models (how they were formed)  

Here are some goals to try to beat with demo projects. Below are some example files that classify various emotions with their accuracies, standard deviations, model types, and feature emebddings. It will give you a good idea on what to brush up on as you think about new embeddings for audio and text features for models. 

| Model Name	| Feature embedding | Accuracy	| Standard Deviation	| Modeltype| 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |

## Dataset summary 

TBA, will post more about this this weekend. 

## Downloading datasets

TBA, will post more about this this weekend. 

## Making new datasets 

If you would like to make a new dataset, please check out the sub-repository called [youtube_scrape](https://github.com/NeuroLexDiagnostics/train-emotions/tree/master/youtube_scrape). You can browser through existing links that we used for training videos in the past in the playlist folder of that repo. Instructions also are there for how to make new playlists. 

We can download the videos and extract features for you if you provide us the playlist URLs.
